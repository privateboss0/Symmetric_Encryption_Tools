# Symmetric_Encryption_Tool
This is a packaged version of part of my MIT cryptography project with the most secured version of the tool being AES256 in year 2024.
This tool encrypt files and folders using a one-time-password to protect confidential files on your linux system.

How to Install:

1: From your home directory type [ wget https://github.com/privateboss0/Symmetric_Encryption_Tools ]

2: Check your home directory for the file "security-tools" and type [ Bash security tools]

3: You will see two folders created. (a) Cryptography (b) SymmetricEncryption

4: go into the directory using [ cd SymmetricEncryption ] 

5: Type [ ls ] to list the content of the directory which should contain "securefile" and "securetext"

6: Type [ ./securefile ] to run the application. NOTE: The application can only be run from the "SymmetricEncryption" directory.
